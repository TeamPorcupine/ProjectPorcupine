Project Porcupine: A Base-Building Game...in Space!

## About

Project Porcupine was created to serve two purposes:

1. To act as a tutorial to teach people how to make a full,
  complex, and multi-featured game inside of Unity (as opposed
  to the more typical one-off, single-feature tutorials that
  are more common.)

2. To provide a basic skeleton for any game that requires a
  tile-based map with self-governing agents (i.e. characters)
  as well as highly customizable objects (i.e. XML/Lua defined
  furniture.)  To this end, we would be making a prorgram themed as
  a starbase-construction game -- though there's no reason that 
  someone couldn't produce something with a wildly different theme
  or purpose (including not being a base-building game at all.)

**However, our true ultimate goal is to produce a community-developed
base building game in a similar style to Dwarf Fortress or RimWorld!**
