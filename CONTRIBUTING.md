## Style Guidelines

We have standardized on Microsoft's [C# Coding Conventions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx) and [General Naming Conventions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229045(v=vs.110).aspx), with a few exceptions.

* Avoid using 'var', even when the type would be clear from context. Verbose typing is best typing.

Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, we are standardizing on what should be Microsoft Visual Studio's default code formatting rules. If you are using MonoDevelop (as many of us are), please go to your preferences and set the C# source code formatting rules to the MVS setting:
